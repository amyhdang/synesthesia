# synesthesia
This is a final project I completed for my Programming Basics class. I thought it would be interesting to combine neuroscience and design, so I made a tool that visualizes letters as colors based on the neurological phenomena of synesthesia. Each letter is matched with a different color using JS datasets, so text is visualized as interesting color patterns.
